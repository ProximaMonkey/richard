   The information in this chapter is likely to change. I haven't spent
   much time on the admin-side of things.


Changing the theme/style/look-n-feel

Override the CSS, JS and templates.

.. todo:: flesh out how to override css, js and templates


Adding videos

.. todo:: how to add videos to the site


Editing videos

Removing videos
===============

Updating the search index
=========================

Updating the index is a manual process. It's possible we could update the
index as data is changed, but richard is currently not set up that way.

Do this to update the index::

    ./manage.py rebuild_index
